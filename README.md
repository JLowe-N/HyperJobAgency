# HyperJobAgency
My implementation of the HyperJob Agency project as suggested by the HyperSkill.org Learning Platform.  
Uses the Django Python framework to create a job posting website.  Introduces concept of User Auth in Django.
Web service will allow the owner to publish job vacancies and for users to publish their resumes.
